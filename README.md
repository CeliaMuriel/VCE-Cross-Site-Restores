# VantageCloud Enterprise infographics

## What VantageCloud is

Teradata offers solutions to keep your data warehouse or data lakehouse in the three leading Service Cloud Providers: AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform. The umbrella term for this offering is VantageCloud.
* VantageCloud Enterprise (VCE) is the solution to host large data warehouses in the Cloud. It is meant to optimise performance and uses the traditional Teradata architecture.
* VantageCloud Lake (VCL) is the new Teradata cloud-native database. It is ideal for both data lakehouses and data warehouses. Furthermore, Lake is built to optimise cost storage while speeding up the response to your critical queries.

Enterprise and Lake offer the complete set of Teradata analytic functions, for Machine Learning, Data Science, and traditional reporting, in a bundle called ClearScape Analytics.

## VCE infographics: the content of this repository

I gather high-resolution infographics and cheatsheets in this repository, each dedicated to explaining a VantageCloud **Enterprise** feature or the different setup options.

I published every infographic in separate posts on [my blog](https://celiamuriel.com/) with some further detail. You have below a list with every article and a summary of its content:
* [From Zero to Hero in Cross-Site Restores in VantageCloud Enterprise](https://celiamuriel.com/from-zero-to-hero-in-cross-site-restores-in-teradata/) explains the Cross-Site Restores feature in VantageCloud Enterprise. This feature allows you to quickly create a Disaster Recovery site for your Production database or launch a test environment based on an existing one.
* [Teradata VaaS on GCP: Network configuration](https://celiamuriel.com/teradata-vaas-on-gcp-network-configuration/) contains a cheatsheet with the key network elements you need to connect with your Teradata VaaS on GCP and a detailed explanation.

This repository doesn't include an exhaustive list of all VCE configuration options and features, but it gathers the infographics I made when I needed to explain something to a customer.

If you want to know more about Teradata's offering or specific details that my infographics don't cover, check the following sites:
